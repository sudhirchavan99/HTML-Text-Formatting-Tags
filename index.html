    <h2 style="color: red;">Adilshah Perturbed:</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The Court of Adilshah at Bijapur was passing anxious days, due to the growing exploits of Shivaji.<br>
        The Sultan summoned all his situation. All the Sardars including those known for their exploits and those comparatively unknown attend.<br>
    Badi Saheba, the Dowager Queen, who personally looked after the Adilshahi administration from Bijapur Was also present.<br>
    The one question before the assembly was "<mark><i>How to bring Shivaji to book and break his revolt.</i></mark>"</p>
    <p>Badi Saheba asked a straight question to her <b>Sardars,"Tell me, who is willing to march against Shivaji and put an end to his rebellion?"</b></p>
    <p>The court became silent. Everybody sat quietly in his place and started looking at the next person, for who would dare accept the challenge of fighting Shivaji?<br>
    Just then a giant of a man came forward and bowed respectfully before the throne. His name was <strong><em>Afzalkhan</em></strong></p>
    <h2 style="color: red;">The Khan accepts the Challenge:</h2>
    <p>The khan accepted the challenge and picked up the betel leaf from the salver as a mark of acceptance. <strong>"Shivaji. Who is Shivaji?</strong><br>
    <em>"I shall arrest him and bring him here or if that is not possible, I shall bring his dead body."</em></p>
    <h2 style="color: red;">Swaraj in Danger:</h2>
    <p>At this time Shivaji was at Rajgad. He got the news of Afzalkhan's movements. He immediately saw that his Swaraj was in great danger.<br>
    But he did not lose courage. He knew that the khan was full of stratagem and had a huge army with him. Shivaji's kingdom was very small in comparison<br>
    and so was his army. He could see that he could never hold his own in open battle against the Khan. His only hope was in some strategic move that would take the Khan by surprise.<br>In 
consultation with Jijabai and with her blessing, Shivaji Maharaj shifted his headquarters from Rajgad to Pratapgad.</p>
